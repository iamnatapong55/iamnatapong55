I am a data science professional with 4+ years professional experience together with data engineering, machine learning and automation projects. In particular, I am interersted in aggregating data platforms and building useful applications to allow more people in making use of them. Also, this would allow me to gather more meta-data to understand people, algorithms and improve my projects. I integrte data sources and build data warehouse myself to formulate big data and publish the data science applications to help people live their life easier.
